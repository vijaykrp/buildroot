	  PeerVPN is a software that builds virtual ethernet networks
	  between multiple computers.

	  A virtual network built by PeerVPN uses a full mesh topology.
	  All nodes talk directly to each other, there is no need for a
	  central server. If one node goes down, the rest of the network
	  is unaffected.
